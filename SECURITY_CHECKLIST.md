## 🎯 Critical Security Items

### 1. ⚠️ API Keys and Credentials

#### GitHub Secrets Configuration
- [ ] **ANTHROPIC_API_KEY** - Claude API key secured in GitHub Secrets
- [ ] **UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY** - Unsplash API credentials
- [ ] **PEXELS_API_KEY** - Pexels API credentials  
- [ ] **GEMINI_API_KEY** - Google Gemini API key
- [ ] **OPENAI_API_KEY** - OpenAI API key
- [ ] **WP_USER** - WordPress username
- [ ] **WP_APP_PASS** - WordPress application password
- [ ] **YT_API_KEY** - YouTube API key (optional)

#### Security Requirements
- [ ] All API keys are stored ONLY in GitHub Secrets
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials in any source files
- [ ] `.env` files are properly gitignored
- [ ] `.env.example` contains no real credentials
- [ ] Environment variables are accessed via `os.getenv()`

### 2. 🔒 Code Security Audit

#### Sensitive Data Protection
```bash
# Run security scan for exposed secrets
grep -r "api_key\s*=\s*['\"]" scripts/ --include="*.py"
grep -r "password\s*=\s*['\"]" scripts/ --include="*.py"
grep -r "secret\s*=\s*['\"]" scripts/ --include="*.py"
grep -r "token\s*=\s*['\"]" scripts/ --include="*.py"
grep -r "sk-[a-zA-Z0-9]*" scripts/ --include="*.py"
```

- [ ] No hardcoded API keys found
- [ ] No hardcoded passwords found
- [ ] No exposed secrets or tokens
- [ ] No test credentials in production code

#### Input Validation & Sanitization
- [ ] All external inputs are validated
- [ ] HTML content is sanitized (XSS prevention)
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (if applicable)
- [ ] Command injection prevention
- [ ] Path traversal prevention

### 3. 🛡️ GitHub Actions Security

#### Workflow Security
```yaml
# Check .github/workflows/daily-blog.yml
- [ ] Uses latest action versions (@v4, @v5)
- [ ] Minimal required permissions
- [ ] No script injection vulnerabilities
- [ ] Secrets are properly referenced
- [ ] No echo of sensitive data
```

#### Permission Scoping
- [ ] Workflow has minimal required permissions
- [ ] No write access to repository unless necessary
- [ ] Secrets are not exposed in logs
- [ ] Pull request workflows are restricted

### 4. 🌐 WordPress API Security

#### Authentication
- [ ] Application passwords used (not main password)
- [ ] HTTPS enforced for API calls
- [ ] Authentication headers properly set
- [ ] No credentials in URLs

#### API Security
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented
- [ ] Error messages don't expose sensitive info
- [ ] Proper error handling for auth failures
- [ ] Timeout configurations set

### 5. 🔍 Dependency Security

#### Package Vulnerabilities
```bash
# Run security audit
pip install safety
safety check -r requirements.txt

# Check for known vulnerabilities
pip install pip-audit
pip-audit
```

- [ ] All dependencies are up to date
- [ ] No known security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Minimal dependency footprint
- [ ] Lock file present (if applicable)

### 6. 📁 File System Security

#### Directory Permissions
- [ ] Output directory has appropriate permissions
- [ ] Temporary files are properly cleaned up
- [ ] No world-writable directories
- [ ] Sensitive files are protected

#### File Operations
- [ ] Path validation prevents traversal attacks
- [ ] File uploads are validated (if applicable)
- [ ] Temporary files use secure methods
- [ ] No execution of uploaded content

## 🚨 Security Best Practices

### 1. API Key Rotation
- [ ] Document API key rotation schedule
- [ ] Procedure for emergency key rotation
- [ ] Monitoring for compromised keys
- [ ] Backup authentication methods

### 2. Logging & Monitoring
- [ ] Sensitive data not logged
- [ ] Error logs don't expose secrets
- [ ] Failed authentication attempts logged
- [ ] Anomaly detection configured

### 3. Error Handling
- [ ] Generic error messages for users
- [ ] Detailed errors only in secure logs
- [ ] No stack traces exposed publicly
- [ ] Graceful degradation on failures

### 4. Network Security
- [ ] HTTPS enforced for all external calls
- [ ] Certificate validation enabled
- [ ] Timeout configurations set
- [ ] Retry logic with backoff

## 🔧 Security Tools & Commands

### Quick Security Audit
```bash
# Full security scan
make security-check

# Or run individually:
# Check for secrets
./scripts/security_scanner.py

# Dependency audit
pip-audit -r requirements.txt

# Code vulnerability scan
bandit -r scripts/

# OWASP dependency check
safety check
```

### Pre-Deployment Verification
```bash
# Verify no secrets in code
git secrets --scan

# Check file permissions
find . -type f -name "*.py" -exec ls -la {} \;

# Verify .gitignore
git check-ignore .env
git check-ignore *.key
git check-ignore *.pem
```

## 📋 Deployment Security Checklist

### Pre-Deployment (Development)
- [ ] Run full security audit
- [ ] Review all recent code changes
- [ ] Verify test coverage includes security tests
- [ ] Check dependency vulnerabilities
- [ ] Review error handling and logging

### Deployment Process
- [ ] Use secure deployment methods
- [ ] Verify HTTPS on all endpoints
- [ ] Check API key configuration
- [ ] Validate environment variables
- [ ] Test fallback mechanisms

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Monitor initial execution logs
- [ ] Verify no sensitive data in logs
- [ ] Check API rate limits

## 🚫 Common Security Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Credential Management
❌ Hardcoding API keys in source  
❌ Committing .env files  
❌ Logging sensitive data  
❌ Using weak authentication  

✅ Use GitHub Secrets  
✅ Use .env.example templates  
✅ Sanitize all logs  
✅ Use application passwords  

### 2. Input Handling
❌ Trusting user input  
❌ Direct command execution  
❌ Unvalidated file paths  
❌ Raw HTML insertion  

✅ Validate all inputs  
✅ Use parameterized commands  
✅ Sanitize file paths  
✅ Escape HTML content  

### 3. Error Handling
❌ Exposing stack traces  
❌ Detailed error messages  
❌ Leaking system info  
❌ No rate limiting  

✅ Generic error messages  
✅ Log details securely  
✅ Hide system details  
✅ Implement rate limits
